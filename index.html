      <h3>ABOUT ME&nbsp;</h3>
      <p>Hey Everyone! It's Tarnni here, your Wollongong local cover artist. Music is such a large part of my life, and being able to incorporate that into my work,&nbsp; allows me to spread the love and harmony that music can bring with the world.   &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Music is my way of expressing myself as a person and connect with those around me, in hopes to make them feel through the vector of song. I believe my passion for music and performing has mading me a more approachable, and overall a well rounded person, making me a very easy person to work along side.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>As a young artist, I am still exploring the wonders of music and experimenting with the new technology and tools avaliable to create a sound unique to me, but with every performance I am able to expand on this and become an even better performer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
     
<p>My 10 years of professional vocal training at one of the most prestigious vocal achademies in the Illawarra has given me the opportunity to learn about a variety of music genres and how I can combine them to make music fit for any event. My training has extended passed solo vocals and into the world of ensemble, choir and band training, expanding my knowledge and ability to use harmonies, teamwork and performance to make my music more enjoyable for both myself and my audience.</p>
